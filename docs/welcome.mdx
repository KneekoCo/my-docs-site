# Welcome to the keekCo Task Tracker Docs

This site is a showcase of how I use **Docusaurus** to create professional, visually structured technical documentation. The purpose of this documentation set is to walk through a real example: building and managing a **Notion-based Task Tracker** for a personal or project portfolio.

Whether you're here to see how I organize my own workflow or to explore how Docusaurus can be used to publish rich, image-supported guides—you're in the right place.

## What’s in This Guide?

This documentation is more than a tutorial. It’s a real-world implementation showing:

- How I use **Notion** to manage a projecta
- How I document tools and processes with **clarity**
- How I structure content using **MDX**, **components**, and **admonitions**
- How I incorporate **labeled visuals** to enhance learning
- How I maintain a clean layout using **Docusaurus themes**

## Why Docusaurus?

Docusaurus provides a fast, elegant way to build documentation sites using Markdown and React. For someone like me—who values both usability and polish—Docusaurus allows:

- Custom theming and interactivity with MDX
- Clean navigation and search
- Easy Git-based publishing (like GitHub Pages)
- Reusability across multiple guides or projects

This documentation is built with all native Docusaurus tools and design conventions, with a focus on practical use, clarity, and front-end readability.
