# How to Build a Simple Task Tracker in Notion

Use this guide to create a Notion-based task tracker that helps you manage your Docusaurus portfolio project.



## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Open Notion and Create a New Page

- Go to your Notion home page Link: [https://www.notion.so](https://www.notion.so).
- Click **+ New Page** in the sidebar.

<img src="/img/TaskTracker_NewPage.png" width = '80%' />



- Name it something like `Docusaurus Portfolio Tracker`.


### 2. Add a Database Table
Open Notion and go to your new page (e.g., Docusaurus Portfolio Tracker).
Click inside the page where it says “Press Enter to continue with an empty page” (if it's blank).
Type /table and you’ll see a dropdown with options.
Select “Table view – Database” from the list.
Notion will automatically create a new full-page database table titled “Untitled”.
Rename the table by clicking the title and typing a new one, such as Portfolio Task Tracker.
You now have a fully functional table to begin adding and organizing your tasks.



### 3. Set Up Your Table Structure
Rename the default columns and add new ones as needed:

| Column Name     | Type           | Purpose                                      |
|-----------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------|
|  Task Name     | Title           | Describe the task clearly                   |
|  Status        | Select          | Use: `To Do`, `In Progress`, `Done`         |
|  Priority      | Select          | Use: `High`, `Medium`, `Low`                |
|  Due Date      | Date            | Target completion date                      |
|  Notes         | Text/URL        | Extra info, links, or commands              |

To change a column’s type, click its title → **Property Type** → choose the correct type.



### 4. Add Your Tasks
Fill in the table with the tasks for your Docusaurus portfolio. Example:

- Initialize Docusaurus project
- Fix dark/light mode CSS
- Deploy to GitHub Pages
- Add Notion tracker guide (this!)


### 5. Use It!
- Sort by due date or priority
- View progress at a glance
- Toggle to board view with `/board` for a Kanban style if desired


##  Why Use This?
- Organize your portfolio development
- Stay focused and on schedule
- Demonstrate Notion and project management skills to recruiters or clients


##  Pro Tip
Link this Notion tracker in your portfolio or Docusaurus site footer to show off your workflow.
